# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

Updating the Readme file..
FOr setting up the local environment, you need to have Docker installed on your system.
No need for logging in.
We'll ue some docker commands on our terminal and then set up our environment for development.
docker -v is used for checking out if Docker is installed on our system.
We need to work with the command docker-compose up in order to install some libs for our dib (task at Anythink).
After that you can use the localhost link provided by Ness to complete the quest.
Thanks.
Nimish.
